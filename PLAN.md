### Sprint 1.3: Real-time Operations
- [ ] Dashboard showing service status (connected/idle/processing)
- [ ] Real-time log streaming to web interface
- [ ] Manual trigger buttons (test connection, run check)
- [ ] Configuration reload without restart

## Phase 2: Monitoring & Visibility (Medium-High Priority) üìä
*Sprint Goal: Add comprehensive monitoring and reporting*

### Sprint 2.1: Statistics & Reporting
- [ ] Message forwarding statistics (daily/weekly/monthly counts)
- [ ] Sender activity breakdown
- [ ] Recipient engagement tracking (if SMTP supports it)
- [ ] Failed forwarding alerts and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Export reports as CSV/PDF

### Sprint 2.2: Audit Trail & Search
- [ ] Database integration with GORM (SQLite for simplicity)
- [ ] Store forwarded message metadata (timestamp, sender, subject, recipients)
- [ ] Search interface for historical forwards
- [ ] Message status tracking (pending/sent/failed)
- [ ] Configurable retention policies

## Phase 3: Enhanced Reliability (Medium Priority) üîß
*Sprint Goal: Production-ready stability and error handling*

### Sprint 3.1: Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Exponential backoff for IMAP/SMTP connection failures
- [ ] Dead letter queue for failed forwards
- [ ] Health check endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] Prometheus metrics integration
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for external services

### Sprint 3.2: Configuration Management
- [ ] Environment variable override support
- [ ] Hot-reload configuration changes
- [ ] Configuration validation on startup
- [ ] Backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Migration scripts for config format changes

## Phase 4: Security Enhancements (Medium Priority) üîê
*Sprint Goal: Production-ready security*

### Sprint 4.1: Authentication & Secrets
- [ ] Replace plaintext passwords with secure secret storage
- [ ] Support for external secret providers (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets)
- [ ] JWT-based web authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control (admin/viewer roles)
- [ ] HTTPS support with TLS certificate management

### Sprint 4.2: Security Hardening
- [ ] Rate limiting for web interface
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] Audit logging for configuration changes

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Lower Priority) ‚ú®
*Sprint Goal: Power user features and integrations*

### Sprint 5.1: Smart Filtering
- [ ] Regular expression support for sender filtering
- [ ] Subject line filtering capabilities
- [ ] Content-based filtering (keywords in body)
- [ ] Time-based filtering rules
- [ ] Whitelist/blacklist management

### Sprint 5.2: Integration & Automation
- [ ] Webhook support for forwarded messages
- [ ] REST API for external integrations
- [ ] Slack/Teams notification integration
- [ ] Email templates with dynamic content
- [ ] Scheduled forwarding (delay/batch processing)

## Phase 6: Scalability & Multi-tenancy (Future) üöÄ
*Sprint Goal: Support multiple organizations/tenants*

### Sprint 6.1: Multi-tenant Support
- [ ] Database schema for multiple tenants
- [ ] Tenant isolation and configuration
- [ ] Per-tenant authentication
- [ ] Resource quotas and limits
- [ ] Tenant management interface

### Sprint 6.2: Performance & Scaling
- [ ] Horizontal scaling support
- [ ] Load balancing for web interface
- [ ] Database optimization and indexing  
- [ ] Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes manifests)

## Technical Debt & Maintenance üßπ
*Ongoing throughout all phases*

- [ ] Increase test coverage (unit + integration tests)
- [ ] Add end-to-end testing with test email servers
- [ ] Documentation updates (API docs, deployment guides)
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Dependency updates and security patches
- [ ] Code quality improvements (linting, formatting)

## Implementation Notes

### Technology Stack Recommendations:
- **Web Framework**: Standard Go net/http with gorilla/mux for advanced routing if needed
- **Database**: GORM with SQLite (simple) or PostgreSQL (production)
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendering with templates + HTMX for interactivity
- **Authentication**: Sessions + bcrypt, later JWT for API
- **Secret Management**: Start with encrypted config, migrate to external providers

### Deployment Considerations:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing YAML configs
- Provide migration path from CLI-only to web-enabled
- Ensure web interface is optional (CLI remains fully functional)
- Support both single-binary deployment and container deployment

### Success Metrics:
- Reduced time to add/remove recipients (from minutes to seconds)
- Increased visibility into forwarding operations
- Reduced configuration errors through validation
- Improved operational reliability and monitoring

## Getting Started

### Phase 1 Implementation Order:
1. **Sprint 1.1** - Start with basic web server and authentication
2. **Sprint 1.2** - Add configuration management UI
3. **Sprint 1.3** - Implement real-time features

### Key Design Principles:
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing CLI functionality must remain unchanged
- **Optional Web UI**: Users can choose CLI-only or hybrid mode
- **Security First**: Authentication and input validation from day one
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface that reduces configuration errors
- **Maintainable**: Clean architecture that supports future enhancements
